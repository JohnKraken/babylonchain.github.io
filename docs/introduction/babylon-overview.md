# Babylon Overview

Babylon is a project that designs security protocols for the decentralized world.
Our mission is to scale Bitcoin to secure the decentralized world.
To this end, Babylon utilizes the three primary facets of Bitcoin: Bitcoin as an asset, its reliable timestamping service, its most censorship-resistant blockspace in the world.
To leverage these facets, Babylon is developing three innovative security-sharing protocols: Bitcoin Staking Protocol, Bitcoin Timestamping Protocol, and Bitcoin Data Availability Protocol.
Through these pioneering protocols, Babylon envisions a more secure and decentralized future.

Babylon is a proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain that brings the security of Bitcoin to other PoS blockchains.
It consists of two security sharing protocols between Bitcoin and PoS blockchains:

- **Bitcoin staking:** This protocol allows Bitcoin holders to stake their Bitcoin to a PoS blockchain, and
- **Bitcoin timestamping:** This protocol sends succinct and verifiable timestamps of PoS blockchains to Bitcoin.

The following figure provides the high-level architecture of the Babylon system.
The two protocols enable enormous security-related use cases for the decentralized world.
One primary use case is to bring BTC security to PoS chains.
